This is a simple Python program that displays a text file in a terminal at
modem speeds. Early 1980s speeds were 300 and 1200 baud, so you can try that if
you want to see what signing into a BBS at the time was like:

    % python modem_simulator.py fidonet.txt 300
    Welcome to FidoNet!
                        __
                       /  \
                      /|oo \
                     (_|  /_)
                      _`@/_ \    _
                     |     | \   \\
                     | (*) |  \   ))
        ______       |__U__| /  \//
       / FIDO \       _//|| _\   /

I used a 300 baud modem for a year, then saw a friend's 1200 baud modem
signing into a BBS. My subjective experience was that the page loaded
near-instantaneously. In reality it probably took 3 to 5 seconds.
